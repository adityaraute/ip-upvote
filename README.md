demo: http://ip-upvote-demo.herokuapp.com

I reverse engineered the UrbanDictionary upvote system, written in golang. And I don't really care what the original upvoter is built with.
## Why Do I do this type of stuff ?
* *I love to waste my time.*

## How the UrbanDictionary upvote system work ?
* UrbanDictionary is a very popular website where anyone can post definitions/meanings of words.
* The correct meaning selected by the number of upvotes. [People can flag sick meanings]
* [An Example](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Simp) if you like to give that a try.
